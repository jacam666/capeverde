                            Many tourists stay in the hotels and do not see the poverty beyond the hotels. Pop into town and support the local businesses there. Cape Verde is generally a
                            very safe country but tourism does lure people from other African countries and many of the
                            street sellers are not Cape Verdean. As in any country, keep your personal items close to you. If
                            you do not want to be bothered by the street sellers turn your hotel bracelet inside out, (as they
                            can pretend they are from your hotel), or just tell them that you have been to their shop before.
                            There is always a minority in any country, but the majority listen when you say that you are not
                            interested.

                        Many children do not brush their teeth regularly. Tourists feel sorry for the children and give
                        them sweets, unaware that they do not brush their teeth. On our activity events, we always try
                        and ensure that each child gets a toothbrush and toothpaste at the end of the event.<br />

                        At My Cape Verde, we try to encourage donors to be as eco-friendly as possible Reusable

                            you are able to donate one that is no longer needed. Unwanted spectacles/reading glasses will
                            be donated to health centres.
                            The shanty towns can be very dusty and dirty. Travel cots are beneficial for keeping babies and

                        Support a sports club/team or community centre. Many children play sports, but families
                        cannot usually afford the correct footwear. The majority of houses are small and children are
                        sent outside to play. Footballs, basketballs, skipping ropes etc can help keep children
                        physically and mentally fit. Drugs and alcohol abuse can be avoided with mental stimulation.
                        Community centres and music groups can help those less sporty.
